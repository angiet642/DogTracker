### Purpose 
What is the thing you are proposing and why is it interesting? \

A common issue pet-owners face is discovering that their pet has escaped the house. To prevent this situation, our team is interested in designing a low-power dog tracker using LoRa. Unlike other pet-tracking collars, our system will implement a training technique by emitting a 25KHz sound wave if the pet is found outside of a user-defined geo fence. For example, if the user would like to train their dog to avoid a specific area of the backyard, our device will detect whether the dog is in this region and emit the high frequency sound if so.

### Proposed schedule
| Week  | Date | Tasks |Complete|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| Week 7 | Feb 13-Feb 19  | Order parts <br />Review PCB and Schematic with Steve and Joanna   | In Progress|
| Week 8 | Feb 20-Feb 26  | Submit PCB for fabriciation | |
| Week 9 | Feb 27-March 5  | Bring up and test boards | | 
| Week 10 | March 6-March 12  | Demo | | 



### Verification
How will you know if you’ve achieved the goal? \

### Demo Plan
What will the demo look like? What will the write up look like? \

### Challenges
What are the most difficult steps and how will you address these ASAP? \
Can you get the H/W? Do you need to write code? How much? \
Stuff that you’re worried about, you know, the nagging stuff…
